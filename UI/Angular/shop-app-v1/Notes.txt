Arch.. issues
----------------------

===> state/model/ui-data is scattered across UI components
===> state & state-change logic & network/service calls 
     are tightly-coupled with UI components
===> if same state is required in multiple components 
     either we should duplicate that state in components or we should pass via input properties 
===> Unit-Testing is very difficult in components
===> we cant re-use same components across diffent pages or applications



soln:

   ==> isolate common state & state change logic & n/wing logic from UI components

 How ?

   in NG , using NG service classes   or using Redux
